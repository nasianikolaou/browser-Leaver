This is a script to train on the differences between browser downloaded images and original satellite data downloaded from remote sensing data portals. 

One of the bottlenecks in making EO (Earth Observation) data widely accessible to communities is the accessibility to various data sources. The easiness of downloading an EO image from a browser, comes to the expense of headers and functional metadata that are helping orientate the image retrieval in space and time within the EO context. On the other hand, the difficulty of familiarising with the particular platforms of each EO mission and its supporting datasets often discourages a newcomer to look into and study a newly obtained satellite image. The previews of images found in the browser, although directly comprehensible can be underlabelled and sometimes extensively post-processed. A transparent pipeline on how this is implemented is necessary for informing the wider public on natural events.

In this notebook ways to smoothen this gap between image processing and original data using open source software for newcomers to EO is explored.

The title of the project is inspired from the song "Lover, leaver" of Greta van Fleet.
